PROMPT_DEBUG = """You are a binary code analyst tasked with analyzing a pseudocode function that has a generic or meaningless name. Your objective is to suggest a more descriptive and meaningful function name based on the function's behavior.

# Steps:
1. Infer Variable Names: Start by examining *all* unnamed variables within the function. Use any identifiable function calls to make educated guesses about the variable roles. For example, in a line such as `sigaddset(v2, a1)`, where `sigaddset` is defined as `int sigaddset(sigset_t *set, int signum);`, you could rename `v2` to `set` and `a1` to `signum` to improve readability.
   
2. Analyze Code Behavior: Review each line of code to understand the function's purpose. Consider the operations performed, the nature of inputs, and the expected output. 

3. Rename the Function: Once you’ve comprehended the function's purpose, rename it with a term that accurately reflects its behavior.

# Example:
Given the pseudocode:

```c
int sub_0x40879(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

Upon analysis, you observe that the function returns the sum of two arguments (`a + b`). Therefore, a more meaningful name for this function would be `sum`.

# Task:
Analyze the pseudocode below and suggest a more meaningful function name based on its behavior:
